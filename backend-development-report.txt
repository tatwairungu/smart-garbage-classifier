SMART GARBAGE CLASSIFIER BACKEND DEVELOPMENT REPORT (Group 2)
===============================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
-----------------
This document outlines the development process of a Flask-based backend API for an AI-powered garbage classification system. The backend serves as the computational engine that processes uploaded images through a pre-trained MobileNetV2 deep learning model and returns classification results to the frontend application.

TECHNOLOGY STACK
-----------------
Primary Technologies:
- Flask 2.x web framework for API development
- TensorFlow 2.x with Keras for deep learning model integration
- NumPy for numerical computations and array processing
- Pillow (PIL) for image processing and manipulation
- Python 3.8+ as the runtime environment

Supporting Libraries:
- Flask-CORS for cross-origin resource sharing
- Werkzeug for WSGI utilities and file handling
- OS module for file system operations
- JSON for data serialization

ARCHITECTURE AND SYSTEM DESIGN
-------------------------------
The backend follows a microservice architecture pattern with the following structure:

apt3025-garbage-collection/
├── app.py (Main Flask application)
├── garbage2_best.h5 (Trained MobileNetV2 model)
├── v2_garbage_finetuned.h5 (Alternative model version)
├── uploads/ (Temporary file storage directory)
├── paper9.jpg (Test image samples)
├── paper87.jpg
├── paper88.jpg
└── paper89.jpg

- HTTP request handler for image uploads
- Machine learning model loader and predictor
- Image preprocessing pipeline
- Response formatter and error handler
